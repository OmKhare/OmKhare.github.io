Position: Project Lead

Tech Stack: React, Node.js, SQL

Designed, developed, and deployed a full-stack application for a Chemical Testing Laboratory Built a React frontend for chemists of the laboratory to help them keep track of tests to be performed on raw materials. It included features like digital signature, role-based logins, calculating test results, and making dynamic reports for 150+
tests with time-to-time database backups.


Following are some of the screenshots of LIMS:
