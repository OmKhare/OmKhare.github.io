## Education

- **Georgia Institute of Technology** — MS in Computer Science, GPA: 4.0/4.0 (Aug 2024 – May 2026), Atlanta, GA  
  Coursework: Systems for ML, Big Data Systems, Database System Implementation, Deep Learning, AI
- **COEP Technological University** — BS in Computer Science, GPA: 9.2/10.0 (Aug 2020 – May 2024), Pune, India

## Experience

- **Cloudflare — Software Engineer Intern (May 2025 – Aug 2025, Austin, USA):** Built a snapshot-consistent vector listing operation in Rust (up to 5M IDs) shipped via REST, CLI, and SDKs; moved insert/upsert to edge metals to remove rate limits and cut timeouts by 30%; preserved full validation logic through the edge migration with zero customer impact.
- **Systems for AI Lab (SAIL), Georgia Tech — Research Assistant (Jan 2025 – May 2025, Atlanta, USA):** Added dynamic resource allocation and checkpointing to lower large-model retraining costs by 35%; introduced decoder weight sharing (3–6 layers) for ~25–30% faster training; improved semantic segmentation accuracy by 1.9% on Cityscapes and 2.3% on COCO.
- **Deutsche Bank — Software Development Intern (May 2023 – July 2023, Pune, India):** Built an LLM-driven sentiment analysis and summarization pipeline (GPT-4) with a React.js front end; deployed on AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda); added a vector-embedding “Related articles” section to speed discovery by 20%.
- **Samsung Research — Software Research Intern (Jan 2023 – May 2023, Remote, India):** Built an on-device lightweight graph database with a SPARQL parser for RDF optimization, supporting 1M triples; added locking and multithreading with ACID properties for up to 10 concurrent connections and cut query time by ~60%.

## Projects

- **StudyBuddy AI App (Jan 2025 – May 2025):** Created a Swift framework with 10 reusable APIs for search and summarization and a SwiftUI app used by 40+ students; implemented an agentic workflow (search → retrieve → combine) that improved response accuracy and task success by 25%.
- **FinSight — Mixed RAG Financial Analytics (Aug 2024 – Nov 2024):** Fine-tuned multimodal LLMs on 9,000+ data points and built a RAG system combining textual and visual insights, improving market trend prediction accuracy by 12% over FinGPT.
