Hello there! My name is Om, and I'm an avid problem solver with a strong dedication to leveraging my skills in pursuit of innovative solutions. My expertise span broadly across the field - from full stack web development and system design to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I am pursuing Master's in Computer Science (MS CS) at Georgia Institute of Technnology. I completed my B. Tech. in Computer Engineering from COEP Technological University with an honors in Data Science and Machine Learning securing CGPA of 9.2/10 and a department rank 7/186. Currently, I work as a teaching assistant for a Graduate Natural Language Processing (NLP) course at Georgia Tech. I have previously worked as a Summer Analyst at Deutsche Bank where I worked on Machine Learning and UX project. I have also worked as a research intern at Samsung Prism where I worked on making a light weight graph database for andoid smartphones.

Beyond my technical acumen, I love to stay abreast of current technology trends, constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills in this rapidly evolving field. I also actively invest in the stock market, finding it to be an engaging pursuit that complements my broader interests. In my free time, I like to travel, hike at nearby hills, push myself to new limits while weight lifting at the gym, and watch tv shows or movies.
