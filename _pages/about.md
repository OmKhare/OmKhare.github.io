Hello there! My name is Om, and I'm an avid problem solver with a strong dedication to leveraging my skills in pursuit of innovative solutions. My expertise span broadly across the field - from full stack web development and system design to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Currently I am a final year student pursuing Bachelors in Technology from COEP Technological University. Throughout my academic journey, I have held various positions of responsibility, fostering a passion for collaboration and teamwork. With a mix of professional and research experience, I have been exposed to different challenges which have honed my skills and broadened my perspective, ultimately shaping me into a versatile and adaptable individual. 

Beyond my technical acumen, I love to stay abreast of current technology trends, constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills in this rapidly evolving field. I also actively invest in the stock market, finding it to be an engaging pursuit that complements my broader interests. In my free time, I like to travel, hike at nearby hills, push myself to new limits while weight lifting at the gym, and watch tv shows or movies.
